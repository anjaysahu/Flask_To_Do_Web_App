# To-Do Web App

## Overview

A simple, session-based To-Do application built with **Flask**. The application allows users to manage personal tasks using core **CRUD** operations without requiring a database, leveraging Flask browser sessions for local data storage.

## My Role & Technical Contributions (Python Development)

As the Python Developer on this project, I was responsible for the core backend logic and system reliability:

*   **Backend Routing**: Developed Flask routes to orchestrate the retrieval of tasks and manage task lifecycle events.
*   **Session-Based State Management**:
    *   Implemented secure, signed cookie sessions to maintain user-specific task lists.
    *   Managed session synchronization to ensure data persistence across requests.
*   **CRUD Logic Implementation**:
    *   Engineered the backend logic for adding, updating, and removing tasks.
    *   Integrated validation to handle empty inputs and prevent processing of invalid data.
*   **System Reliability**:
    *   Implemented checks to verify task existence before modification or deletion.
    *   Ensured the backend remains stable and responsive under different user operations.
